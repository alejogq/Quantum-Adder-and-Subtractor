Quantum Computing fast development is leading to the emergence of a wide variety of software development frameworks. 
In general, in these frameworks users can implement quantum algorithms and circuits, evaluating their behavior through 
simulations, and in some cases, executing them on Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices. IBM has been a pioneer 
in this field, providing public access to their devices through the IBM Q Experience Platform, using Python's open-source 
framework Qiskit. In this paper, we present the development of a n-bitstring half-adder and half-subtractor algorithm in 
Qiskit, analyzing the behavior on the IBM Q Experience simulator and real quantum processors.
